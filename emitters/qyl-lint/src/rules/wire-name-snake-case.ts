// INV-3 — one casing convention for every JSON body property in the contract.
//
// The contract used to run two regimes side by side: OTel-projection models
// carried explicit snake/dotted `@encodedName`, everything else shipped its raw
// camelCase TypeSpec name. Identity scalars lived in both, so the same value
// reached clients under two or three different keys. This rule abolishes the
// camelCase-passthrough regime: a body property either declares a snake_case
// wire name or already is one.
